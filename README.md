# Big_Data_Bowl_2021

The repository is a collection of my work for the 2021 NFL Big Data Bowl Submission.
My final submission write up can be found here: [Kaggle Submission](https://www.kaggle.com/pelky33/identify-defenders-vulnerable-to-defensive-holding)

The submission involves analysis and model building to determine if certain defenders are more vulnerable to defensive holding penalties.
